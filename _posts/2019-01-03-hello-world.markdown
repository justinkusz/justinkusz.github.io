**Hello, world!** 

**You're reading my very first post on my shiny, new blog.**

*(For those interested, I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You can find the source for my blog [on github](https://github.com/justinkusz/justinkusz.github.io).)*

#### *Why are you starting a blog?*

Good question. It's not something I'd been particularly interested in doing in the past. Up until now, I've primarily used social media (specifically, Facebook) as an online outlet
for my thoughts. Unfortunately, over the years, I've become increasingly disenchanted with Facebook (and with social media in general).

**So, today, I deleted *12 years* worth of my posts from Facebook** (and it felt pretty good).

In the early days of social media, I thought it would be a democratizing force in the world. Give a voice to the voiceless. Bring people together. Things haven't quite turned out that way.
And with recent revelations of Facebook's business practices, I feel less inclined to allow them to *own my data*.

**But I'd be lying** if I said that's why I removed all those posts, and why I'll be using my own blog from now on.

**The real reason is more embarrassing.** Looking through those old posts (dating back to 2005), I started to realize that I really don't like the way I behaved on the platform.
(If you followed me on Facebook circa 2009, *yikes*. I'm sincerely sorry. I'm not sure what was going on with me around that time; but looking back, *wow* was it cringe-worthy).


Sure, a lot of that has to do with the fact that I was nearly 15 years younger when I joined; but, even more recently, I wasn't using the platform in a thoughtful way.
The vast majority of my posts were at best snarky, often self-aggrandizing, and at worst self-pitying. That's not who I *think* I am, and it's certainly not who I *want* to be; so
it stands to reason that it shouldn't be how I *portray* myself.

My hope is that, by using this blog as a platform, I'll force myself to be more contemplative, respectful, and helpful in expressing my thoughts to an online audience. It's far too easy to type out
a short, snarky status update on Facebook (that makes me feel smart while I belittle others). It takes far more thought and self-reflection to open up a text editor and type out a full-fledged
blog post, particularly one in which I discuss my shortcomings.

So, here I am. If you've read this far, **thank you**. And if you've been following me on Facebook, and you ever thought I seemed like a massive jerk, **I very sincerely and regretfully apologize**. Chances are, we met
in "real life" before we were "Facebook friends". I doubt very highly that you would have bothered connecting with me online if I had come across as a jerk in real life. **You deserve as much respect from me online as I gave you offline.**

So, there's that.

#### *So, you're giving up Facebook?*

Hey, man. Cool your jets. It's still a very convenient way to connect. There are loads of people there that I want to keep in touch with. I might not use it as much anymore, but
my email address and phone number are there for any of my old friends to use to get in touch with me. And by all means, post on my timeline or send me a message. I might not see it immediately,
but I promise I'll get back to you. 

And on the (admittedly, probably rare) occasion that I write a blog post, I'll
post the link to Facebook.

(Spoiler alert: they'll probably just be hiking photos).
