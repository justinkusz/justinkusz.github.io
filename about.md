Hey! I'm Justin. I'm an aspiring software developer living in Asheville, North Carolina. I received a B.S. in Computer Information Systems from Valdosta State University in 2017. 

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, pub trivia, learning new tech, and playing the occasional video game.

I started this blog as an excuse to post hiking pictures, and maybe some thoughts on technology here and there.
